* Veracious lambda
Make ~λ~ behave like ~lambda~.

** What is it?
It's a small library which extends the syntax by providing a
reader-macro for λ character. It makes the reader treat ~λ~ as a
shorthand for ~lambda~ in the code. Precautions taken to treat only
symbol with this exact name to undergo transformation, so you can rest
assured that your strings stay unchanged.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

#+END_SRC
** How to enable?

1a. Copy (or symlink) the directory with the ~veracious-lambda~ to
~~/quicklisp/local-projects~, then type ~(ql:register-local-projects)~
in the REPL.

1b. Just copy the files into your project.

2. Use ~:around-compile~ asdf defsystem attribute:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:defsystem :your-system
  :license "Your License of Choice"
  :depends-on (:<...>
               :objective-cl)
  :around-compile (lambda (next)
                    ;; uiop:symbol-call is needed because objective-cl system
                    ;; is not yet loaded by the time the defsystem form is read,
                    ;; so the package also doesn't exists, which causes an error
                    (uiop:symbol-call '#:veracious-lambda '#:enable)
                    (unwind-protect (funcall next)
                      (uiop:symbol-call '#:veracious-lambda '#:disable)))
  :components
  ((:file "packages")
    <...>
#+END_SRC
